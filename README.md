# Movie Review Sentiment Classifer

Daniel Cersosimo

For this project, I utilize a dataset of moview reviews from IMDb which exhibit two features. One the raw text and the other the associated sentiment of positve or negative as a label. From
this, extensive I conducted extensive NLP via converting the text of each review into high dimensional vectors via wrd embedding which I then employed in the contructing of models to 
associate certain arrangemnts of magnitudes within these vectors towards sentiment classes with the hope of said mdoels being able to effectlvey garner the ability to differentiate between 
the two. These models performed quite well and their respective performances and further details into the project can be seen in the attached notebook and report. Thank you.
